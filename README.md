Major releases (5.0.0) indicate changes that will be incompatible with previous versions. 
Minor releases (5.1.0) add functionality while still being backward-compatible (in this example 5.1.0 would be compatible with 5.0.0). 
Patch (often termed Micro in Python) releases are minor bug fixes or security patches that should always be backward compatible (5.1.4).
